# Deep-Learning-using-Python
This is the course taken by Andrew Ng named as deeplearning.ai in Coursera. 
Programming assignments are in Python (few are using TensorFlow and Keras ).

# Introduct
deeplearning.ai is the new course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. He wanted to build a AI power socity and also added "AI is the new electricity".
